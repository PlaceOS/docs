<!-- This is a placeholder page in markdown to be replaced post-mvp with a more pleasing React page -->

PlaceOS is a [software platform](https://place.technology/solutions/platform) which enriches interaction with physical space.
It provides tools to design, build and iterate integrated digital experiences for physical environments. 
To do this, it merges any and all elements - from lighting and AV to entire BMS - without the legacy baggage.

**Integration** of disparate systems, devices and services forms a seamless experience for your space.  
**Automation** boosts workplace efficiency and ease of use for any space.   
**Iteration** lets your space constantly improve and grow with you and your needs.
