## Editing

All content is [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

To aid in version control and encourage clear, concise communication use [semantic line breaks](https://sembr.org/).
This, along with  analysis of language complexity and style will be automatically checked.
These checks are an aid, not a hindrance and can configured via [.textlintrc](./textlintrx).

Corrections, additions or any changes should take place in their own branch (or fork).
When you are happy with your changes, submit a PR for automated proofreading and feedback from a human.

## Deployments

Updates to `master` will automatically trigger a build and deploy :robot:.
