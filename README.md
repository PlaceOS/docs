# PlaceOS Docs

This repository contains all the human-created technical docs, guides and reference material for PlaceOS.
You can read these here directly, or if you'd prefer some nicer typography and layout, head on over to https://place.technology/docs.

## Editing

All content is Markdownâ€”work on this in the editor of your choice.

Corrections, additions or any changes should take place in their own branch (or fork).
When you are happy with your changes, submit a PR for automated proof-reading and sign-off by a human.

## Deployments

Updates to `master` will automatically trigger a build and deploy :robot:.
