# Recommended Hardware
<!-- Worth renaming as it extends beyond hardware to OS & platforms -->

The PlaceOS Platform is vendor agnostic, meaning that it can be used with any other hardware or software with no direct requirements for specific equipment. 

However, here you will find a list of hardware that has been fully tested by PlaceOS and is known to deliver reliable and consistent results on the platform.
