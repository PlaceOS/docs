## Overview

MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). 

It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. 

MQTT today is used in a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, oil and gas, etc.

MQTT allows for messaging between device to cloud and cloud to device. 

This makes for easy broadcasting messages to groups of things.
