<!-- # Interfaces -->

*Interfaces* are web pages that provide users with a direct method of interaction with PlaceOS.
They are suitable for any experiences that lend themselves to screen-based interaction.
Common examples of interfaces are:
- A staff app
- A meeting room control interface
- A booking system

<!-- Should this have a link to one of the demo sites with a staff app - or stills from it -->
<!-- Stub. possibly either substantially expand on it, or roll into another section -->
