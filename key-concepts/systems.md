# Systems

A _system_ is a collection of [modules](modules.md), [settings](settings.md) and basic metadata \(name, description etc\). They provide the main logical building blocks within Engine deployments.

Systems often represent physical spaces \(such as a meeting room\) but can also represent standalone items such as a digital signage endpoint or a non-physical system with information based inputs and outputs.
