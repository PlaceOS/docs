# Zones

_Zones_ are collections of [systems](systems.md). A system can be tagged as a member of any number of zones.

![Zones have settings and a collection of systems.](../.gitbook/assets/concepts-zone.svg)

They serve two main purposes:

1. Logical groupings of systems with common traits \(such as those in the same building, or of the same basic type\).
2. A point to define settings that compose across systems.
