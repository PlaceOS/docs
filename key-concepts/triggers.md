<!-- # Triggers -->

*Triggers* provide a way to dynamically link state and behaviour across different modules.
They define actions that will occur based on certain criteria, such as:
- System state
- Time
- External input such as a webhook

## Customisation

Triggers permit modules to influence the behaviour of other modules directly. 
In PlaceOS backoffice, users can create, assign and manage triggers.
This way, they can customise extensive event driven behaviour. 
That accompanies more complex core system behaviour written in the logic [modules](modules.md).
