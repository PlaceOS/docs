# Triggers

_Triggers_ provide the abiity to dynamically link state and behaviour across different modules. They are used to define actions that fire based on a certain system state, time, or external input from a webhook.

Using backoffice it's possible to create, assign and manage triggers to build event driven behaviour that accompanies core system logic.
