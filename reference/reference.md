Reference guides are _technical descriptions of the machinery_ and how to operate it.

Reference guides have one job: to describe.

> Documents here are auto-generated.
> **Do not edit by hand**.
> If information requires improvement or expansion, this must take place in upstream sources.

Reference material is **information-oriented**.


If you want high-level coverage of topic areas, see the [overview](../overview).

If you want to learn in more detail about a process or feature, try a [tutorial](../tutorial/).

If you're looking for docs to help you with a task, try a [how-to](../how-to/) guide.
