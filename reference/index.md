Reference material is low-level documentation with lots of technical detail.
They are a look into the machinery of PlaceOS itself.

If you want high-level coverage of topic areas, see the [overview](../overview).

If you want to learn in more detail about a process or feature, try a [tutorial](../tutorial/).

If you're looking for docs to help you with a task, try a [how-to](../how-to/) guide.
