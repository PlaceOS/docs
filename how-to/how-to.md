They are directions to achieve a specific goals in the PlaceOS ecosystem.

How-to guides are distinct from [tutorials](../tutorial/):

- A how-to is an answer to a question, or a process to follow

In a how-to guide, you can assume base level knowledge, tooling familiarity and understanding.

If you want high-level coverage of topic areas, see the [overview](../overview).

If you want to learn in more detail about a process or feature, try a [tutorial](../tutorial/).

For low-level detailed technical docs, see the [reference](../reference/) material.
