title: What is PlaceOS?
description: Brief intro to the product
---
PlaceOS is a software platform which makes interaction with physical spaces simple.
It provides tools to design, build and iterate integrated digital experiences for physical environments.

To do this it merges elements on an API gateway, ESB, and traditional BMS, without the legacy baggage.
This allows disparate systems, devices and services to combine as a seamless UX for your _place_, whatever that is.
