title: What is PlaceOS?
---
PlaceOS is a software platform designed to make interaction with physical spaces simple.
It provides tools to design, build and iterate digital experiences for physical environments.

To do this it merges elements on an API gateway, ESB and traditional BMS, without the legacy baggage.
This allows disperate systems, devices and services to combine as a seamless UX for your _place_, whatever that is.
