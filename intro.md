title: What is PlaceOS?
description: Brief intro to the product
---
PlaceOS is a software platform which makes interaction with physical spaces simple.
It provides tools to design, build and iterate integrated digital experiences for physical environments.

To do this it merges elements on an API gateway, ESB (Enterprise Service Bus), and traditional BMS (Building Management Systems), without the legacy baggage.
This allows disperate systems, devices and services to combine as a seamless UX for your _place_, whatever that is.
